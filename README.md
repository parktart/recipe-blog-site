Mock Food Blog Site

Since I'm deep into learning JavaScript right now, I want to go back and practice my HTML and CSS skills by making a mock food blog site. I want to focus on building out a site based on a given design and so I'll use [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/) as a reference.

This is proving to be good practice in using DevTools to inspect and understand a website I didn't build myself. I understand all the CSS used on [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/) and I'm actually running into some unfamiliar HTML elements, so I'm learning about those as I work.

Overall proving to be a great learning experience!
