Mock Recipe Blog Site

Since I'm deep into learning JavaScript right now, I want to go back and practice my HTML and CSS skills by making a mock recipe blog site. I want to focus on building out a site based on a given design and so I'll use [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/) as a reference.

EDIT: This is proving to be good practice in using DevTools to inspect and understand a website I didn't build myself. I understand how to built the design of [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/) with CSS but I'm actually running into some unfamiliar HTML elements, so I'm learning about those as I work!



EDIT: Well that was fun. I should get back to JavaScript now!
